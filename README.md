# House-Price-Prediction
## INTRODUCTION
Buying a home, espicially in a city like Bengaluru is very challenging.The chellenges is like it is not possible for a person to go every single place in the city and check the price of the home that is also dependent on various factors so to overcome this.This project is buid it will predict the estimated price of the home .The feature that estimated price is dependent on are as follows:-                   
Area_type – Describes the area.                                                                           
Availability –When it can be possessed or when it is ready(categorical and time-series).               
Location – Where it is located in Bengaluru.                                                               
Price – Value of the property in lakhs(INR).

Total_sqft –Size of the property in sq.ft.

First step of this project is to pre-process the data.we will cover almost all data science concepts such as data load and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tunning, k fold cross validation etc.![Remove_Outlier](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83052989/117435290-521d6c00-af4b-11eb-8259-da90a87902bc.png)

Secondly, a model is built using sklearn,linear regression,decision tree and lasso using the dataset provided.

Thirdly,a website is built in html, css and javascript that allows user to enter home square ft area, bedrooms etc and When the user will click on the button of predict price python flask server will be called in order to retrieve the predicted price.
